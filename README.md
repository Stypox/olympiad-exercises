# Olympiad exercises

Exercises for Informatics Olympiad. Contains my solutions of some tasks from mostly the [italian training platform](https://training.olinfo.it), [UVa Online Judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/) and [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com), respectively under the `olinfo`, `uva` and `kattis` folders. There are also solutions for problems from other platforms or competitions (e.g. Hashcode or Reply) in the `more` folder, along with some random algorithms or visualizations in the `experiments` folder.

Use the script `template.py` to generate a template for a task from a platform and have it automatically opened in your editor (VSCode, [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) or Atom).
