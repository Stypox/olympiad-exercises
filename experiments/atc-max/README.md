The problem asks to calculate the smallest number of towers needed to connect the upper-left corner to the lower-right corner of the square, and there could be obstacles in the way.
This program tries to calculate the **maximum** number of towers that could be put in the `N*N` square while still respecting the rules (but obstacles are not considered).
